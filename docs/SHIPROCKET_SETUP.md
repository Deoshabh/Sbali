# Shiprocket Integration - Environment Variables Setup

## 📋 Required Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your backend `.env` file:

```env
# Shiprocket API Credentials
SHIPROCKET_EMAIL=<your_api_user_email@example.com>
SHIPROCKET_PASSWORD=your_api_user_password
```

## 🔐 How to Get Shiprocket Credentials

### Step 1: Create Shiprocket Account

1. Go to <https://app.shiprocket.in/register>
2. Complete the sign-up process
3. Verify your account

### Step 2: Create API User

1. Log in to your Shiprocket account
2. Go to **Settings** → **API** → **Add New API User**
3. Click on **"Create API User"**
4. In the pop-up form:
   - Enter a **unique email address** (must be different from your main Shiprocket login)
   - Under **Modules to Access**, select the relevant API modules:
     - ✅ Orders
     - ✅ Shipments
     - ✅ Courier
     - ✅ Tracking
     - ✅ Returns
   - Under **Buyer's Details Access**, choose **"Allowed"** or **"Not Allowed"** based on your requirement
5. Click **"Create User"**
6. The password for the API user will be sent to your **registered email address** (not the API user email ID)

### Step 3: Add Credentials to .env

2. Add the credentials:
   ```env
   SHIPROCKET_EMAIL=<api_user_email@example.com>
   SHIPROCKET_PASSWORD=password_from_email
   ```

## 🌐 Webhook Setup (Optional but Recommended)

To receive real-time tracking updates:

1. Log in to your Shiprocket account
2. Go to **Settings** → **API** → **Webhooks**
3. Add your webhook URL:
   ```
   <https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/admin/shiprocket/webhook>
   ```
4. Enable the toggle
5. Add a security token (optional but recommended):
   - Generate a random token (e.g., using `openssl rand -hex 32`)
   - Add it as `x-api-key` header
6. Save the webhook

### Webhook Security (Optional)

If you added a security token, update your webhook handler to verify it:

```javascript
// In backend/controllers/shiprocketController.js
exports.handleWebhook = async (req, res) => {
  const securityToken = req.headers["x-api-key"];

  if (securityToken !== process.env.SHIPROCKET_WEBHOOK_SECRET) {
    return res.status(401).json({ success: false, message: "Unauthorized" });
  }

  // ... rest of the webhook handler
};
```

Add to `.env`:

```env
SHIPROCKET_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_generated_token
```

## 📦 Pickup Address Setup

1. Log in to Shiprocket
2. Go to **Settings** → **Pickup Addresses**
